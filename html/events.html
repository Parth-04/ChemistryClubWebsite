                        Heisenberg is our club orientation organised every year for freshers to introduce them to various club activities and events. 
                        Students participated in a team of 3. 
                        Heisenberg involved various fun games and quizzes, mind-boggling riddles, and exciting prizes for the winning teams!

                        Reactorious is our project series launched by the club so that students can learn practical applications of all chemical and technical knowledge. 
                        Students were required to work on an idea under the professor’s guidance, ranging from optimised reactors to the concentration of microbes in drinking water. 
                        Including various hot fields like chemical sciences, nanotech, biosciences, energy sciences, etc.

                        In this challenge, students were required to design a safe egg landing device, put an egg in it and make it have a free fall. 
                        The challenge was to keep the egg unbroken. 
                        The device should be capable of protecting the egg.
